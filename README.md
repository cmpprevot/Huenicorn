## Description

Huenicorn is a free ambilight driver for Gnu/Linux.
In other words, Huenicorn allows you to extend the colorful atmosphere of your computer screen to your Hue light bulbs in real-time.
Huenicorn provides a simple web interface to assign specific portions of screen to the light bulbs you desire and save the settings for further entertainment sessions.

## Project status

Huenicorn 1.0.11 is available.

### This revision brings

* Webroot files are now embeded to binary to make installation easier
* Initial setup now allows to select between multiple bridges if detected

## Getting Started

* Before using Huenicorn, you need to define some entertainment area on your Hue bridge through the official application provided by Philips.

### Requirements

* Gnu/Linux system running with graphics sessions based on X11 or Wayland
* Philips Hue bridge with registered lamps

### Building Huenicorn

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/openjowelsofts/huenicorn.git
cd huenicorn
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The output is a standalone executable called "huenicorn".
When running Huenicorn, make sure that the ```webroot``` directory is in the cwd (current working directory).

### Executing program

* Run the executable named "huenicorn" in the way you prefer (Terminal if you want some text feedback)
* Open your favorite web browser at [127.0.0.1:8215](http://127.0.0.1:8215)
Browser will spawn automatically for the initial setup and as long as no light profile has been saved
(Service port can be edited in configuration. Default is 8215)

#### Initial setup

When executed for the first time, Huenicorn spawns the setup page in your favorite browser. It consists of a step-by-step wizard to locate your Hue bridge on the network and register an user on it.

Upon setup proper setup termination, Huenicorn will resume in its ordinary execution workflow.

The webpage can then be refreshed to reach the Light Manager interface.

#### Ordinary execution worflow

<details>
  <summary>Wayland-specific step</summary>
  <br/>

  At initialization, the grabber will ask you to select some source through a screen sharing portal. Pick the desired screen and validate by clicking "Share".
</details>
<br/>

Huenicorn will automatically select a the suitable screen-grabber for the graphic session.

At startup, Huenicorn will look for a saved profile and start its color streaming execution.

If you want to assign lights to some portions of your screen, open the web interface and drag'n'drop the available lights from the left list to the right one.

When a synced light is selected in the list, its portion of allocated screen can be adjusted in the screen partitioning section.

Once you are satisfied with the layout, you can save it as a profile and it will be automatically reloaded for further executions.

As long as no profile has been saved, light management interface will spawn automatically at startup.

### Configuration files

The configuration files can be found in your home directory at ~/.config/huenicorn/
config.json contains the bridge-related configuration.
profile.json contains the saved channels geometry for an entertainment configuration.

The data structure of these files is JSON.

#### config.json

  This file contains some parameters that can be manually edited after initial setup.

* **boundBackendIP**:  (String) IP address to bind the service on
* **bridgeAddress**:  (String) Address of the Philips Hue bridge
* **credentials**:
  * **clientkey**: (String) 32 hexadecimal characters key provided by initial setup
  * **username**: (String) Base64 or UUID username provided by initial setup
* **interpolation**:  (Unsigned) Identifier of the desired subsample interpolation function
  * Nearest = 0 : Cheapest. Low quality on high detail. Can cause the lights to flash
  * Cubic = 1 : Slow and harsh (kept for test)
  * Area = 2 : (Recommended) Smooth and respectful of overall content
* **profile**:  (String) Name of the current user-defined light profile
* **refreshRate**:  (Unsigned) Screen capture and light update frequency
* **restServerPort**:  (Unsigned) Port on which the web UI must respond
* **subsampleWidth**:  (Unsigned) Width of the treated image subsample

Here is an example

```json
{
  "boundBackendIP": "0.0.0.0",
  "bridgeAddress": "192.168.0.10",
  "credentials": {
    "clientkey": "01234567890ABCDEF0123456789ABCDE",
    "username": "AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz-0123456789012"
  },
  "interpolation": 2,
  "profileName": "profile",
  "refreshRate": 60,
  "restServerPort": 8215,
  "subsampleWidth": 32
}
```

#### profile.json

This file contains a list of channels related to an entertainment configuration.

* **Channels**: (Array) List of entertainment configuration channels
  * **active**: (Boolean) whether the channel is active or not
  * **channelId**: (Unsigned) Index of the channel in the entertainment configuration
  * **devices**: (Object) List of devices for the channel
    * **id**: (String) UUID of the device
    * **name**: (String) User-defined name of the device
    * **id**: (String) Manufacturer-defined name of the device
  * **gammaFactor**: (Float) Light brightness modifier
  * **uvs**: (Object) Pair of coorinates for sub image treatment
    * **uvA**: (Object) Top-left corner coordinate
      * **x**: (Float) x coordinate
      * **y**: (Float) y coordinate
    * **uvB**: (Object) Bottom-right corner coordinate
      * **x**: (Float) x coordinate
      * **y**: (Float) y coordinate
* **entertainmentConfigurationId**: (String) UUID of the related entertainment configuration

#### Shutting down

Huenicorn can be shut down through the web interface or by sending a termination signal.

## Troubleshooting

### I can't see/select any entertainment area from the web interface

This can happens if the credentials are invalidated for various reasons and can usually be fixed following these steps:

* Shutdown Huenicorn if running
* Remove (or rename) the ```~/.config/huenicorn/config.json``` file
* Restart Huenicorn
* Redo the initial setup and at the credentials step, press the "I don't have credentials yet" button
* Follow the instructions involving pressing the bridge's physical button and finish the setup

Huenicorn should now be able to properly list Entertainment Areas and stream colors

### My lights display raibow shift instead of my screen color

#### Reason

Huenicorn could not load any Grabber for the desktop session. It then loads the "Dummy grabber" to still allow access to the management panel and ensure bridge communication.

#### Solution

Check missing dependencies for the running session type

If you are unsure of the current session type, enter the following command:

```bash
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
```

Then refer to the dependencies installation section for your distro.

The CMake output tells which Grabber is available for build:

```cmake
cmake ..
...
[cmake] Able to build X11 Grabber !
[cmake] Able to build Pipewire Grabber !
...
```

Wayland requires the ```Pipewire``` Grabber.

### Crash after screen selection on Wayland session

There is a known bug affecting Huenicorn depending on build parameters. This problem was "half-solved" since 1.0.9 but can somehow persist under certain circumstances.

Huenicorn can then be rebuilt with different optimisation flags to hopefully end with a functional result.

Clear the content of the ```build``` directory (if it exists).

Reconfigure the project with the following line instead of ~~```cmake ..```~~


```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<CMakeBuildType> -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ ..
make
```

```<CMakeBuildType>``` has to be replaced with one of the values below:

* Release
* MinSizeRel
* Debug
* RelWithDebInfo

Then try running Huenicorn again to see if it can now go beyond screen selection.

### Huenicorn still crashes immediately

Check the ```~/.config/huenicorn/config.json``` file and check the following properties:

```subsampleWidth``` : Must be higher than 0 and a divisor of your screen resolution.
```refreshRate``` : Must be between 1 and your screen refresh rate
